## Introduction

This website marks the beginning of my journey into frontend development,While my primary focus lies in backend development, this project will help me establish a strong frontend foundation, which will complement and enhance my backend skills in the long run.

Through this project, I'm learning how to build interactive and dynamic web pages with React, while also gaining experience in designing user-friendly interfaces. I'm exploring key concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and handling user events.

## Goals

The main goals for this project are:

- **Learn HTML**: How to Structure content semantically and accessibly using modern HTML5 elements and best practices.
- **Learn CSS**: How to Implement: custom styling, animations, responsive layouts using CSS3 and Flex/Flexbox.
- **Learn JS**: How to Write clean, maintainable JavaScript code using ES6+ features and asynchronous programming.
- **Learn React**: Get hands-on experience with React's component-based architecture and state management.
- **Build a Responsive Design**: Ensure the website looks great on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Improve UX**: Provide a smooth, intuitive navigation experience for users, Attempting to use a color system which follows the 60,30,10 color schematic.
- **Showcase My Skills**: Display my skills, projects, and future career aspirations clearly to potential employers or collaborators.

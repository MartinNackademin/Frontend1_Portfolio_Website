## Introduction

This website marks the beginning of my journey into frontend development, with a particular focus on React. While my primary passion lies in backend development, this project will help me establish a strong frontend foundation, which will complement and enhance my backend skills in the long run. The primary goal is to create a functional, responsive, and visually appealing portfolio that reflects my journey and growth as a developer.

Through this project, I'm learning how to build interactive and dynamic web pages with React, while also gaining experience in designing user-friendly interfaces. I'm exploring key concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and handling user events.

## Goals

The main goals for this project are:

- **Learn React**: Get hands-on experience with React's component-based architecture and state management.
- **Build a Responsive Design**: Ensure the website looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
- **Improve UX**: Provide a smooth, intuitive navigation experience for users.
- **Showcase My Skills**: Display my skills, projects, and future career aspirations clearly to potential employers or collaborators.
  
## Features

This portfolio website includes the following features:

- **Home Page**: A welcoming page that introduces who I am.
- **Projects Showcase**: A dedicated section that displays my projects with brief descriptions and links to live versions or GitHub repositories.
- **Skills Overview**: A section that highlights the technologies and tools Iâ€™m currently proficient in.
- **About Me**: A brief background of who I am, my career journey, and aspirations in web development.
- **Contact Form**: A simple form that allows potential employers or collaborators to reach out to me directly.

## Technologies & Tools

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: For building the UI with reusable components and state management.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used to structure and style the website.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content.
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages without full page reloads.
- **Sass**: For better styling management with variables, nesting, and reusable styles.
- **React Icons**: To add clean, minimalistic icons throughout the site.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, thanks to media queries and modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid).

## Future Improvements

Once the website is functional, there are several features and improvements I plan to add in the future with a focus on furthering my learning. These improvements will hopefully expand my skills in various aspects of web development.

- **Dynamic Content**: Implement features such as an interactive resume and project filters for easy browsing.
- **Animations**: Enhance the user experience with smooth animations and transitions.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure full accessibility, including keyboard navigation and improved screen reader support.
- **Backend Integration**: Add server-side functionality, such as a contact form with email notifications or a database of projects.
- **SEO Optimization**: Improve search engine optimization for better discoverability on search engines, just for fun.
